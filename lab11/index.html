			<h1>Lab 11 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of the lab was to explore JavaScript events, particularly those triggered by user input.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into a problem where even though the text box and button were showing up on my lab site, it wasn't actually running
						the code; I eventually saw that it was because the line of code linking my JavaScript to my HTML was mislabeled (I had 
						to change "src="./js/lab.js"" to "src="./js/lab11.js"" to match the line of code linking my JS to my HTML in the "Results"
						section of my lab).
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Other than the minor problem I ran into, the lab was otherwise very straightforward. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<h3>JavaScript Results:</h3>
							<p><script type= "text/javascript" src="js/lab11.js"></script></p>
							<input id = "user-name" type = "text" placeholder = "tell me your name (please)">
							<button id = "submit">Submit</button>
