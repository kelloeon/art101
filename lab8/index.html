			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal for this lab was to experiment with callbacks and anonymous functions in a browser console.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only real problem I ran into was having to replace all of the "console.log"s with "document.writeln"; I forgot that you
						can't use them in VSCode.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was pretty straightforward overall! I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of anon functions and callbacks; 
						they're starting to prove pretty useful :)
					</p>
