			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of the lab was to create a file structure within art101, create an index.html file and a CSS file to code my 
						homepage, adding images to both the homepage and to the "Lab 3" page of my website, and publish the final product to Github.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The lab was pretty straightforward, so I didn't run into any major problems. The one semi-major problem I ran into was my image not showing up,
						but I asked a friend and I fixed it by moving the image to lab 3's img folder (instead of keeping it in art 101's img folder). 
						Other than that, I mostly ran into minor formatting problems, which I was able to get through by testing different lines of code and opening it 
						with Live Server to see what the final result might look like; I could then adjust code from there to get the desired result.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It went well! I'm feeling more comfortable with HTML and CSS the more I do it, so the lab this time went a lot more smoothly.
						I'm sure it's also because today's lab was easier than the previous labs, but I had fun writing the code to create and customize my website. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here's a screenshot of my file structure for art101, shown in the bar on the side, and the code displayed is the HTML code for my homepage. :)</p>
