			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of the lab was to experiment with and successfully create a program that runs on loops.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into one minor problem, which was that the list of numbers wasn't displaying when I clicked the button;
						this was solved when I realized that I had used $(".output") instead of $("#output"). From there, it was smooth sailing :D
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The lab itself was pretty straightforward! The loops work almost identically (apart from formatting) to Python loops,
						so I feel like I had a pretty good grasp of the lecture content and the lab from the get-go.
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Click the button to see my JavaScript code run! :)</p>
