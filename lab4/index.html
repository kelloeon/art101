			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to practice pseudocoding. The first task was to break down a common task into pseudocode, meaning 
						each step had to be straightforward and follow a binary logic (the way computers do!); the second and third Tasks
						involved pseudocoding a simple game to emulate what it's like to lay down pseudocode for a project that would,
						from start to end, be based within a computer.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We ran into very few problems; off the top of my head, the only problems we ran into were with trying to decide
						which steps in each of the tasks in the lab would be its own individual step/procedure and which steps would be considered
						sub-tasks. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The lab went fairly smoothly! Serene and I were able to divide the work evenly, and having another person to bounce
						ideas off of and to double check the accuracy of our work helps a lot. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<h3>Task 1:</h3>
					<p>In Task 1, we were required to break down a common, everyday task into steps and procedures and write out a pseudocode for said steps
						and procedures. We chose to pseudocode the task of doing laundry.

					<h3>Tasks 2 and 3:</h3>
					<p>In Tasks 2 and 3, we were instructed to pseudocode a simple computer game. Below is a screenshot of the pseudocode for our Dice Game.</p>
