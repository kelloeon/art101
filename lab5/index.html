			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of the lab was to introduce Javascript code to us. To do so, we were instructed to work with a browser console to 
						practice assigning elements to variables; in this case, we chose a car (or primary mode of transportation) and listed off
						the make, model, year, color, and age as variables. We then put those elements in a Javascript program and coded it through
						HTML and CSS into our website.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The lab itself was fairly straightforward; I didn't run into any particular issues.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I actually had a lot of fun learning about Javascript! It was super cool to see that arrays and objects operate almost identically to
						Python's lists and objects, which I had learned about in high school. As it turns out, I remember more than I thought I did when it
						comes to coding.
