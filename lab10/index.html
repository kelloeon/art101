					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problem I really ran into was that my button didn't show up at first, but I quickly realized after looking at my JavaScript 
						code that I had attributed the very first line to the wrong div id; it was a pretty easy fix and everything worked as intended after that. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was pretty straightforward! I'm starting to feel a lot more comfortable with JavaScript as a whole, and I think after a little more 
						practice and review with DOMs I'll be good to go :)
