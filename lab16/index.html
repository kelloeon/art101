			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to experiment with pulling JSON from an API.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I got really stuck with this lab; I couldn't figure out how to navigate to the correct website link that would give me 
						the information I needed, nor could I get anything to show up, and I ended up asking Rhys for help. They were awesome and
						I was able to get to roughly where I wanted with my lab results.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I still don't really understand JSON, AJAX, or APIs, but I think with some extra time and review I'll be able to have a more solid
						understanding of it. I have a very flimsy understanding at the moment.
					</p>
