			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab is to create a "sorting" function for users to interact with using conditionals in JavaScript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My JavaScript code kept giving me an error, and it took me so long to figure out what it was. I had put a semicolon where I wasn't
						supposed to, and I had no idea that it would break my entire code. I also ran into an issue where nothing was showing up for the 
						output; that ended up being because i had put "let result =" for each if/else if statement instead of just saying "result =".
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I kind of got frustrated when it wasn't immediately obvious to me what the errors were being caused by, but being patient and 
						seeing the issues all the way through was really satisfying. The payoff was totally worth it :)</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
