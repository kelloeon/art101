					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to fix any bugs that were left behind in a previous lab of our choice.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I don't know if this counts as a problem, but I didn't submit any labs that still had bugs in them.
						Because of this, I instead chose to go back and add hyperlinks leading back to my homepage to all of my labs.
						I also went ahead and added the hyperlinks to the rest of my labs on my homepage for easier access to them all.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was maybe the easiest one this quarter; I just needed to make sure that all the links worked, which was simple
						enough to test. </p>
