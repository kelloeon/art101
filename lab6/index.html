					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Using arrays and objects, we were tasked with describing and labeling our various modes of transportation. Our total list
						of modes of transportation was described through an array, while our chosen "main ride" from Lab 5 had its various aspects like
						make, model, and year described via object in JavaScript.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only real problem I ran into was trying to make sure that my JavaScript output was the same color as the rest of
						the text on my page; I tried troubleshooting with a few classmates and my lab partner, Serene, but was unable to get all 
						of the text to turn the same color. As of right now, I'm leaving it as is because it's still technically legible, but I'll
						definitely come back to try and fix this in the future.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was good practice! I feel like it helped make sure that I really understood all of the concepts that were brought up
						in lecture, as well as in the previous lab. I appreciate that they built on top of each other cohesively, it made it easier to
						follow and understand.
