			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of the lab was to successfully experiment with APIs and AJAX.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Many a problem arose this time around! I felt kind of lost throughout the whole lab because I was unable to attend
						lecture, so I was running on the knowledge I had gained from going through the lecture slides and the PokeAPI website.
						My biggest downfall will always be syntax errors; I was having an issue where nothing was showing up, but it was because
						I was trying to call the output with a period instead of a pound sign in JS despite "output" being an ID an not a class. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I need to go back over the slides/lecture content for AJAX and APIs so that I can better understand why my code 
						didn't work the first time around. I think I also need to give myself more patience (and more time so that I can 
						be sufficiently patient as needed) when working on things I don't know how to do the first time around.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<p>Oh no! One of your Pokemon has been, to your disbelief, been hit with every possible status condition. Click the button 
							below to choose a random berry and heal one of its conditions!
						</p>
						<button id="button">Click here!</button>
