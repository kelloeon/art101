					<h2 style="text-align: center;">Challenge</h2>
					<p style="text-align: center;">The lab had us create a basic file structure, use a text editor like VSCode to write the HTML file and style it using CSS, 
						view it in a live browser, and view its elements via Chrome's Inspect feature.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2 style="text-align: center;">Problems</h2>
					<p style="text-align: center;">We didn't run into many problems as we were working on the lab; 
						the work was fairly straightforward. The only real issue we ran into was making sure that our file paths were coded correctly, 
						but we took extra time to double check that our CSS files were linked correctly to the HTML file.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2 style="text-align: center;">Reflection</h2>
					<p style="text-align: center;"> I think all things considered, it went pretty well. I did struggle, though, with the code itself and what each line or tag was for; 
						if I'm being honest, I feel pretty lost right now, but I got all of the code I wrote to work with what knowledge I had, and I'm going to dedicate a day or two 
						just to reviewing all of the basics of HTML and CSS to make sure I really understand. I'm frustrated that I don't have the understanding of the code that I feel like
						I should, but I'm determined to fix that.</p>
