					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of the lab was to create a JavaScript program that scrambles a string that the user inputs when prompted and outputs it.
						The prompt is the user's name.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had two major problems while coding for this lab. One of them was that my website was prompting the user twice every time it opened,
						which I was able to solve after finding out from a friend that the script was being called twice in my HTML: once at the head of
						the document and again in my "Results" section. I grayed out the first time the script was called and it resolved the issue of the 
						window being called twice. The other problem I ran into was that my JavaScript would not show up at all when opening my site. It would 
						prompt the user to enter their name, then nothing would show up in the "Results" section. I eventually found that it was a syntax error:
						I had written "let nameArraySort = nameArray.sort("");" instead of leaving the parentheses empty. I had no idea that such a minor syntax
						error could cause such a major problem, but I'm super relieved to have found it.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I'm actually having fun learning about the three coding languages so far! At the beginning of the quarter, hearing that I had to work in
						three different languages (CSS, HTML, JavaScript) throughout the quarter had me overwhelmed, especially because I had absolutely zero
						experience working in any of them. I'm definitely much more used to it now, though, and the way we've been learning about it has been
						easy to digest so far. I'm also super pleased to find that JavaScript is incredibly similar to Python, the one coding language I 
						have experience in!</p>
