			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and JQuery</h1>
			<div id = "challenge" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to add buttons to our website and, using JQuery and callback functions, change the look
						of certain sections of our website when the buttons are clicked!
					</p>
			</div>

			<div id = "problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into a problem where my buttons wouldn't change the color of the sections they were in when clicked; I quickly
						found that it was just because I didn't do enough formatting and styling in CSS. </p>
			</div>

			<div id = "reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was pretty straightforward! I think I'm still feeling kind of shaky on how to use JQuery, but I'm sure 
						that with more practice that feeling will go away. </p>
